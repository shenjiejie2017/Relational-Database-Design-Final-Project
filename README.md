# Relational-Database-Design-Final-Project
This is my final project for DTSA 5733 - Relational Database Design as part of the Master’s degree program in Data Science at the University of Colorado. The project consists of two files:

1. Relational Database Design Final Project.pdf: This document provides a detailed description of the entire project, outlining the design process, key decisions, and final outcomes.

2. Relational Database Design Final Project Slides.pdf: This is a PowerPoint presentation that offers a quick overview of the project. It’s ideal if you prefer a concise summary of the main points.
